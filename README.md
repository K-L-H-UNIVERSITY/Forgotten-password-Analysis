Given two strings .we have to find the minimum number of steps to convert A string to B string .
We have three operations to perform it .
1) Insert a character
2)Delete a character 
3)Replace a character  
By using this three operations we have to convert string A to  string B
The algorithm we used in these string editing concept we used Levenshtein algorithm to calculates the least number of edit operations that are necessary to modify one string to obtain another string. The most common way of calculating this is by the dynamic programming approach.
